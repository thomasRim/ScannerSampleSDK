		// This can cause problems since Structure SDK apps typically ask the user for permission to use the camera when launched.
		// This leads to the user's first experience with a Structure SDK app being:
		//     1.  Download Structure SDK apps from App Store.
		//     2.  Plug in Structure Sensor to iPad.
		//     3.  Get bombarded with "X app wants to use the Camera" notifications from every installed Structure SDK app.
		// Each app has to deal with this problem in its own way.
		// In the Structure SDK, sample apps peacefully exit without causing a crash report.
		// This also has other benefits, such as not using memory.
		// Note that Structure SDK does not support connecting to Structure Sensor if the app is in the background.
